Here’s what your first 60 days will look like:
Month 1:
Audit and map out our existing Customer Support function (people, processes, performance)
Create a vision for our CS function—what’s possible with this function that we are missing?
Create a plan for improvement & optimization
Create SOPs for the CS function (people, processes, performance)
Start working inside our customer support software, begin talking to clients, responding to tickets, answering phone calls etc!
Month 2:
Create a process for hiring, onboarding, and managing Customer Support Reps
Hire, onboard, & train new hires
Create performance metrics for each person and the CS Team
Offer ongoing training and regular support to help CS Reps improve
Create a weekly report that tracks performance and include qualitative insights that can be used to improve the product, marketing, or sales
About You:
You are insanely organized and addicted to getting things done.
Your natural instinct is to create processes around everything you do—partly because you know the faster you document a task, the sooner you can automate, delegate, or eliminate it.
You are focused. You’re excellent at seeing a task through to completion before moving onto something else.
When you don’t understand something, you try to figure it out on your own first because you’re savvy & resourceful. If you’re still uncertain, you request help without hesitation.
“You down with SOP? Yeah you know me!”—You love creating SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) to make our systems repeatable & scalable.
Your love language is organization & processes. We never question the status of Customer Support because you keep real-time metrics and documentation on all projects.
You have experience training CS Reps to process hundreds of inbound customer service requests daily—including praise, sales questions, payment questions & disputes—seamlessly, quickly, and with professionalism & personality.
You can learn a new software faster than I can say “new software” and you’re a systems extraordinaire. You can look at our current systems and identify how to automate tasks we’ve been doing manually for months.
You’re driven by metrics. You know that you can’t improve something unless you measure it, so you develop ways to measure CS performance so we’re always improving.
You’re obsessed with getting things done. If a task is unfinished or unaccounted for, you’re not sleeping until it’s scheduled or complete.
Timeliness and deadlines are your jam. When we have a team call at 10:00am, you show up at 9:55am. When the deadline is Tue at 5:30pm, you have it done by Mon at 9:30am.
You communicate clearly and confidently. If you disagree with something, you communicate that without hesitation.
One of your superpowers is customer empathy, and you can train CS Reps to transmit that through their responses.
You have experience creating decision trees, refund policies, and saved replies that boost sales and save that day.
You have experience creating a dashboard where CS Team performance is clear.
Excel & Spreadsheets excite you. When you hear VLOOKUP, you do a happy dance. And if you don’t know how to do it, you’re hopping on YouTube or popping into a forum to figure it out in a jiffy.

It’s like an always-on dinner party. We believe that good friendships are the foundation of everything, and we built Clubhouse to make it easier to fill your life with them.

We launched in 2020 and have grown quickly in the time since. Each day, millions of people are now exploring the hallways of Clubhouse, creating rooms about every topic imaginable.

We take pride in being a small and productive team, with a relentless focus on our product and the community. As a company we are well funded, with backing from a16z and dozens of the best angel investors in the world, providing us with years of runway. We love what we do and have a lot of work ahead of us. So if you’re a talented builder, come join the club!

The Role

As a Product Data Scientist, you will work closely with our product and engineering teams to formulate and answer key questions about our product. You will play a central role in collecting, modeling, and analyzing data, and will drive meaningful changes to our product and user experiences based on your findings.

In this role, you will report to our Head of Data Science. We are a remote friendly-company — with our headquarters in San Francisco and a strong commitment to ensuring people can do great work here and thrive without having to live near an office. This role is open to candidates across the U.S.

Who you are

You are curious, inquisitive, and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems. You are able to identify high impact problem areas with little direction. You have a healthy skepticism about data and know when to dig deeper into a problem.

You have the technical skills to work independently. You are comfortable with advanced modeling and statistical techniques and are highly fluent in SQL and Python. You have deep experience with experiment design and analysis. You have experience as a data scientist at a fast growing company and have a proven record of impact.

You are a strong communicator and are able to explain complex concepts to a wide audience. You are adept at crafting clear and impactful data visualizations.

You are meticulous and forthright. You are experienced with finding clear answers despite messy data sets, and are able to catch data issues as they arise.

You bias towards action. You like to build and ship - favoring practical choices, speed and a respect for sequencing. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast.

You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You thrive in fast-paced environments and are comfortable with not knowing the answer to something. You are willing to roll up your sleeves no matter what the challenge is.

You take pride in what you do. You care deeply about your work. You read through details and think about every bit of the user experience. If something seems off, you come up with a good solution and fix it without being asked to do so. You’re proactive with suggestions and people know they can count on you to get things done.

You enjoy your work. You love what you do, not because you feel you have to, but because you’re so excited to create something big for the world. Your favorite thing to do is to take on a huge challenge and pull it off.

You care about doing the right thing. You value diversity and go out of your way to ensure others feel welcome. You enjoy hanging out with your teammates, have a low-ego, and make the workplace more fun for everyone.

What you will do

In this role, you will play a key part in defining the data culture within Clubhouse and ensure that we have principled, data-driven decision-making processes. As part of the early data team, you will work on numerous zero-to-one projects and will have a direct impact on our product direction. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our product and engineering teams on high-profile feature launches that affect millions of people.

There are numerous complex product questions that we would look to a data partner to help the team untangle. On a given day, you may be performing and sharing complex analyses that inform a wide variety of decisions. Or you may be playing a hands-on role in new feature launches, ensuring that we understand the impact of policy changes on users and can identify potential issues early in the process. You will have the opportunity to do foundational analysis on important, unsolved questions across a wide range of problem spaces.

You’ll grow and improve rapidly. At Clubhouse you’ll be working with an incredible team, who love to learn from and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, challenged by your teammates, and growing your skills on a daily basis.

You’ll shape the product strategy. You will get to use your own product (and talk with others while they are using it) every day, and have significant input into its development. Your ideas will always be heard. Your work will vary over time and will cover a variety of areas. On a given day, you may be launching a new way of ranking support tickets, analyzing trends in different types of user behavior, or finding ways to proactively identify content in violation of our policies.

You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle.

You’ll create something meaningful. Social products allow people to connect in ways that were never before possible. When the telephone was invented, it suddenly allowed people to speak with others across the world. Thanks to FaceTime, grandparents everywhere can now watch their grandchildren grow up. At Clubhouse, you’ll be figuring out something entirely new for the world—a positive product that brings people’s voices together for deep and meaningful conversations, creates new relationships, builds empathy across cultures, entertains people, and helps people develop ideas that change the course of their lives.
This position is fully remote, and includes competitive base pay, a comprehensive health benefits package, company equity, 401k, plus additional benefits and stipends. The salary for this position is between $171,000 and $215,000. It may vary based on the applicant’s level of experience, education, specialized knowledge, skills, and the market rate for similar positions. The salary range is subject to change and may be modified in the future.

As an early team member at Clubhouse you will be a critical voice and have significant influence over the direction of the company. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your development, and ensure this is the single best work experience of your life.

Our users come from all walks of life, and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Our company is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.

44,Data Scientist,Ntropy Network,"$130,000 a year Employer est.","Remote in New York, NY",PostedPosted 30+ days ago,/rc/clk?jk=fe6e382847752143&fccid=dd616958bd9ddc12&vjs=3,"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following are required
- the tools: Python, Pandas / Polars, Matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
SQL and fundamental database operations.
- recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).
fluency in statistics and probability.

FAQ

Do you plan to sell customer data?

Ntropy is on a mission to enable products without data barriers. We will never sell customer data and will always put privacy and customer benefit ahead of any auxiliary financial gains.

What is the interview process like?

1. Send us problems you have solved before and how. Please include as much detail as possible: code, algorithms, derivations, proofs, etc. We will then do a video call to kick things off and go through it (45 mins).

2. We will give you a take-home project related to whatever we are currently working on (3-4 hours). Alternatively, if you have a relevant project that you worked on previously that demonstrates your skills as an engineer, you are welcome to use that instead.

3. We will then do a deep-dive through the project over a call and discuss the implementation, improvements and bottlenecks.

Above all, we respect your time and commitment and will keep you up to speed on where we are at during the whole process.

What are your hiring plans?

back-end - Python + Rust (where performance matters)
compute - AWS, GCP
ML - PyTorch, ONNX, Triton

Work / life balance?

We are a startup which requires you to put in a lot more work and soul than a regular job. We believe, however, that nothing easy is worth doing. We will expect a lot from you, and you should expect a lot from us.

What is the compensation?

About Peek
1.1 billion people worldwide have preventable or curable vision loss, including 43 million who are blind. And rates are rising. Vision loss can have devastating effects on education, social status, and livelihoods. Simple, cost-effective treatments exist, like cataract operations or glasses. Further, the burden of most eye conditions is not borne equally. The majority of cases are in Africa and Asia, where eye care services are limited and people travel long distances to reach hospitals.
Peek Vision is a social enterprise that powers eye health programme providers to strengthen systems and service delivery with a software and data intelligence platform.
We are dynamic, impact-driven and award-winning . Our solutions for school & community eye health providers include:
1. Population-level eye health surveys
2. Programme design
3. Software
4. Data insights
For a brief introduction explaining how Peek powers school and community eye health programme providers to make unmet eye health needs visible, watch this Introducing Peek Vision video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ch20cw3Rdc
Peek Capture is a smartphone app that allows non-specialists - such as teachers and community health workers - to conduct vision screening and eye health surveys in homes, communities and schools. It integrates the visual acuity check from our award-winning Peek Acuity Android App, allowing anyone to check visual acuity using a smartphone.
Peek Admin is a web platform that displays the real-time data entered in Capture, allowing healthcare providers to understand where the need is greatest and how to improve services.
They are used to power our two main offers:
Peek for School and Community Eye Health Programmes
We use Peek Capture to help eye health providers reach communities and join up local services, while data from Peek Admin helps ensure those who need treatment are reached.

About Us
BlastPoint is a B2B data analytics startup located in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh. We give companies the power to solve business problems through discovering the humans in their data and understanding how they think. Serving diverse industries including energy, retail and transportation, BlastPoint’s software platform helps companies plan solutions to customer-facing challenges, from encouraging green behavior to managing customers’ financial stress. Founded in 2016 by Carnegie Mellon Alumni, we are a tight-knit, forward-thinking team.
Why You Should Work for Us
Solve Challenging Problems: BlastPoint’s platform incorporates cutting-edge approaches to geospatial data, psychographic clustering, data enrichment and a dynamic visualization environment, all at scale. We’re working to break new ground by pulling insights from high-dimensional data. And we’re pushing ourselves to try new and better ways to approach every step of our process.
Have An Impact: Small but mighty, BlastPoint’s growth is due to big companies increasingly trusting us with supporting key decisions using their most sensitive data. What we do positively impacts the lives of millions of Americans (and beyond).
Make Positive Change in the World: Our solutions reduce paper consumption, help struggling families pay their bills, and promote clean energy. We also offer our platform for free to nonprofits and civic-oriented organizations.
Employee-Focused Culture: We support the individual needs of our team, from schedule and time-off flexibility to generous compensation benefits. We also tailor growth opportunities, from skills training to industry conferences.
Job Description
We’re looking for a thoughtful, curious, and resourceful Data Scientist to join our growing team. You’re comfortable presenting insights to clients, and thrive in situations where you have to learn about and solve a client’s specific problems. This role is the technical face that accompanies our clients’ experience working with us, meaning that you will be the person leading them to solutions by presenting project results, interacting with clients in a consultative manner, and supporting overall customer success. This is a fully-remote position with the option to work from our home office in Pittsburgh, PA, with occasional company meetings in-person.
Core duties include:
Architect, develop and deploy models and algorithms using customer, open source, and proprietary data; assess model quality, and validate and iterate on those models
Own the process of integrating customer data, analyzing it using our methodology and your data instincts, and make it deliver value to the customer
Evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of public and private data sources, choose the right ones for our platform, and make them ready to sing harmony to a customer dataset’s melody
Help design and automate our customer dataset analysis and insights delivery process, to smoothly handle a wider variety and higher velocity of data
Act as the technical bridge between the customer and the product, making our tools useful, relaying product feedback, and customizing to a client’s needs where necessary
Leaning on your empathy and leadership skills, you will work with our clients in a consultative capacity, learning about their particular needs and being their advocate both internally and externally. That means participating in client meetings, leading technical discussions, presenting project results, interacting with clients in a consultative manner, and other technical customer-facing engagement, as needed.
We expect the balance of your work day-to-day to be 60-70% client project-centric work, 20-30% scripting to improve our shared data analytics tooling, and ~10% account management or support needs. The hope is that feedback from your client experiences can directly make our systems more efficient, and eventually more self-serve, reducing the need for clients to have consultative project teams at all.
Professional Requirements
2+ years of experience in data science or educational equivalent; strong preference for additional experience in software, R&D, consulting or adjacent fields
Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience in computer science, mathematics, statistics, economics, or similar

A passion for discovering the secrets and solutions hidden in large datasets
Highly attentive to detail, with a skeptical sixth sense about signal-vs-noise
Ability to self-motivate, self-organize and work independently in a challenging, fast-paced environment with several ongoing concurrent projects
A willingness and demonstrated ability to work collaboratively with a small team; excellent internal communication skills
A can-do mentality, with the willingness to roll up your sleeves and take initiative to solve something when necessary
Knowledge of a wide variety of machine learning and statistical analysis techniques, their advantages and drawbacks, and areas of best applicability

Some experience with ETL processes or Data Prep tools is helpful
Experience in or exposure to the constraints of a startup environment is helpful
Ability to commute to the Pittsburgh, PA office quarterly, for company-wide meetings, and to travel to client sites when occasionally necessary for a project"

186,Data Scientist,PerfectRec,"$130,000 - $300,000 a year Employer est.","Remote in Seattle, WA",PostedPosted 30+ days ago,/rc/clk?jk=22409aeaca7a375b&fccid=dd616958bd9ddc12&vjs=3,"About PerfectRec
PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)

We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves.
We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.
A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact
PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact.
Founder Led, Founder Funded
Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine.
Working At PerfectRec
We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.
PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.
What You'll Bring
Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You'll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress.
Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You'll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1.
Willingness to teach and learn. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You'll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this.
Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential data sources are limitless. You'll be able to evaluate and explore existing sets of data, suggest new sources of data, and be able to build models that learn from this data in novel ways.
Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You'll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest.
What You'll Do
Create and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts.
Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains.
Identify ways to evaluate and compare competing models.
Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories.
Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library.
Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team.
Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate.
Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time.
Relevant Experience
We believe that everybody has the ability to learn and grow. So, relevant doesn't mean required or that you need everything on the list (this isn't a Pokédex). If you've used other tools, languages, and frameworks that are similar to what is listed, please apply! We only list specific tools so that you know the tech stack you're walking into.
Python or R.
Exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
Classical machine learning techniques like classification, regression, regularization, and cross-validation.
sklearn, Keras (or other deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch).
Recommender systems, including learning-to-rank.
SQL.
Technical writing.
Salary & Benefits
We believe in offering generous compensation and benefits tailored to our all-remote workplace. We pay well because we want to work with highly motivated people that will help make the company successful.
Pay Range and Level of Role
$130,000 - $300,000 salary and stock options which vest over 4 years. We are hiring data scientists with different levels of experience. Compensation is based on background and experience.
Benefits
100% remote and no cost-of-living pay cuts. We want you to work where you work best and we are not going to ""adjust"" your pay if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.
We pay 100% of your and your dependents' healthcare premium in a high-quality, national PPO plan for US-based employees. For international employees, we will work with you if you're not covered by your national health plan.
We will buy the office equipment you need to succeed. Lots of companies are miserly about equipment. We are not going to do that because your time is valuable.
401k with generous matching. Once we have 20 employees, we'll set up a 401k program with generous matching.
Generous PTO. We trust everyone to take time off appropriately for themselves. We're pro-regular vacations - not taking regular breaks isn't good for individuals or the team. Once we have 20 employees, we will establish a more formal PTO policy.
Worry-free sick days. If you're sick, take the time off to get well. Just let your manager know as soon as practicable.
Free products that we're reviewing. We are becoming product experts together, and we will send you cool stuff like monitors and TVs as we add new recommendation lines. (Unfortunately, we probably won't be able to do this for cars.)"

We are hiring our first Product Data Scientist to help our product, marketing, engineering and customer support teams make data-driven decisions about what and how we build for our customers when helping them manage their money. This is a unique opportunity to not only be embedded with an early stage team where you'll have close proximity to strategy and building so you can produce action-oriented analyses, but you'll also influence our data infrastructure and tooling decisions.
Because you will work with bitcoin data across different sources (internal systems, blockchain, lightning network, etc.), an understanding of how these technologies function or demonstrated experience or interest working with this data is a big plus.
You will report to our Head of Business within Bitcoin Wallet. You can be based anywhere remotely in the United States, as well as in several countries around the world including the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, among other countries.
Come build the future of money with us! Learn more through our newsletter here.
You Will:
Empower our team to use data to make business decisions as we build a global product from its earliest days- an opportunity to build data analysis into the infrastructure of a team from day 1
Develop both backwards-looking analysis on product performance, marketing effectiveness, monetization and pricing and other main product and business decisions, as well as forward-looking predictive models to help us better understand customers and their needs (e.g. cluster analysis that help us map customer segments back to product usage, retention models)
Empower the teams with data and help them to make decisions on improving product features and building a meaningful roadmap (e.g. funnel metrics, analysis of churn and CS data, etc), as well as influencing important decisions like pricing based on acquisition and retention insights
As a member of the Business team, you'll have the product and business context to be able to proactively spot trends and connect sometimes seemingly disconnected data sets to help the team develop and prove out hypotheses across the end to end lifecycle, forming cohort analysis on things like acquisition channels, etc.
Navigate external data sets such as publicly available blockchain data insights (eg bitcoin blockchain analysis) to help us understand things like our total addressable market (TAM) as well as SAM and SOM
Design and help run statistically-significant experiments across different cohorts of customers and ensure hygienic approach to things like causation vs correlation
Create models that help us to analyze risk and security threats as well as optimize key decisions on our approach to money movement (i.e. transaction modeling)
Support and guide in our early data infrastructure decisions with product and engineering - as we are a zero to one team, you will get to shape the data infrastructure decisions we make so we have scalable ways of working where data is easily accessible to the right people on our team, all while ensuring that data is secure and aligned with our privacy principles and commitment to customers and partners.

Qualifications

You Have:

Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in the United States. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We launched Pearl Health because we believe primary care providers, armed with the proper tools and resources, can have an outsized impact in achieving high-quality, affordable healthcare. We foresee a shift to an increasingly value-based future where physicians and provider groups will participate in the value they create for the healthcare system and will increasingly require proper tooling, information systems, capital support, and technology to succeed in these models.
We are a team of physicians (Groups), practice-enablement experts (VillageMD, Steward, Stellar), technologists (athenahealth, TrialSpark, Flatiron Health) and health plan leaders (Oscar, Clover, Centivo) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to America's future health.

Support all business lines, including sales and business development, by enabling those teams to nimbly make data-driven decisions, balancing competing goals, and making difficult trade-offs when required.
Partner effectively with our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer toward best-in-class analytics systems to give our physician partners insight into their patient panels.
Support the technology needs of various departments by creating a data-literate ecosystem.
Who you are…

379,Data Scientist,GiveDirectly,"$130,000 a year Employer est.","Remote in New York, NY",PostedPosted 30+ days ago,/rc/clk?jk=5b29daa5e4032564&fccid=9d68fe82291d9c11&vjs=3,"About GiveDirectly
GiveDirectly (GD) aims to reshape international giving – and millions of lives – by providing cash grants directly to the poorest people in the world. The Brookings Institution estimates that $100B of cash transfers would be required to eliminate the poverty gap; the aid sector currently spends $135B each year, much of it on evidence-free interventions. GiveDirectly wants to change that, establishing cash transfers as a benchmark for foreign aid – as the index fund is a benchmark for the financial industry – and in the process accelerating the end of extreme poverty.
GD has raised over $800M since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1 million people, and launched offices in 11 countries across North America, Africa, and the Middle East. We've also supported 19 large-scale, experimental research projects that indicate strong recipient impact of our programs – including the largest universal basic income experiment in history. We use concrete evidence to inform the design of our programs: from research results published in leading journals, to in-depth qualitative work. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company, while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD's leading role within it) have been featured in the New York Times Magazine, This American Life, Foreign Affairs, and The Economist.
We're looking for exceptional talent to grow our collaborative, diverse team. Joining GiveDirectly provides the opportunity to work alongside individuals who come from 21 different countries and speak 69 different languages. We're actively working toward an equitable and inclusive environment for all team members, and seek candidates who will bring diverse perspectives and experiences to our organization. We recruit from organizations across all industries: our team has hailed from sectors including start-ups, government, consultancies, investment banks, and nonprofits.
Across our global offices, our culture is candid, analytical, non-hierarchical, and fast-paced. We value ability, adaptability, and willingness to learn. We offer competitive salary and benefits, as well as performance-based bonuses.
This role is fully remote but working hours must overlap with typical working hours (9am-5pm) in the East Africa timezone by at least 4 hours a few times per week.
About the Field Data team
As we scale to reach millions of people experiencing extreme poverty, we believe that data can transform cash delivery by:
Improving recipient experience
Increasing operational efficiency
Mitigating risk
Conveying our impact to donors
To realize this vision, we are building a best-in-class data team focused on cash delivery: operations, payments, and recipient safeguarding.
You will be the Field Data team's first Data Scientist, reporting to the Senior Data Manager and working closely with the Senior Data Architect. This is an opportunity to join at the inception of the team and guide foundational decisions regarding vision, priorities, and best practices. We are a small (but growing) group with a startup mentality, applying engineering best practices and a product development approach to data.
Our data infrastructure is built on AWS and Databricks, with dashboards and visualizations in Tableau. We primarily use SQL, Python, and R.
About this role
You will deliver insights and decision making tools that help shape cash delivery by determining which projects we take on, how we design them, and how we implement them.
Responsibilities include:
Statistical analysis and predictive modeling. Own process end-to-end: implement statistical methods and build, train, and deploy predictive models to solve problems in cash delivery utilizing code (e.g., Python, R). Current priorities:
Targeting. Implement and improve existing machine learning algorithms predicting poverty level from call-detail records (CDR) and geospatial data. This work enables us to remotely identify eligible recipients at scale, and has been highlighted in WIRED with findings published by our research partners in Nature.
Risk prediction. Develop new risk prediction models that help us design programs and target recipient outreach to keep recipients and communities safe.
Support data quality assurance. Work with the Senior Data Architect to design processes that ensure key metrics, models, and analysis are built on high quality data.
Communication. Collaborate with leaders throughout the organization to define data product requirements, educate them about solutions, and make recommendations.
This role has a high degree of autonomy and the ability to shape our process from the ground up by determining best practices and informing the data product roadmap.

Reports to: Senior Manager, Data

415,Machine Learning Research Assistant,Modern Intelligence,"$7,000 a month Employer est.","Remote in Austin, TX",PostedPosted 22 days ago,/rc/clk?jk=b97ac176c799ad23&fccid=6a2935a9ce526df2&vjs=3,"Modern Intelligence is seeking exceptional students to join the team as a Machine Learning Research Assistant, and contribute to the creation of classical and hierarchical neural networks for American defense, in areas including sensor fusion, decision making, autonomy, complex inference, electronic warfare, and more. This position is the candidate’s choice of half-time or full-time. Interested candidates with a PhD are encouraged to apply to our AI Research Scientist Internship position. This position is open to remote candidates.


About Modern’s Research:
Modern Intelligence is an Artificial Intelligence product and R&D company. Our product line is defense-first, and tackles some of the hardest and most interesting problems of the decade in machine learning, with a current focus on multi-modal domain awareness and complex scene understanding. And our research program focuses on foundational improvements to machine learning that aim to close the performance gap between artificial and biological neural networks. Whereas the current trend in machine learning is towards more data, more GPUs, and models with trillions of parameters, the fruit fly brain needs less than 200,000 neurons to achieve vision, target identification, navigation, and obstacle avoidance that is orders of magnitude more robust than any artificial neural network.

The brittleness and inefficiency of artificial neural networks likely comes from a combination of
artificial neurons having “less compute”,
artificial neural architectures produced by NAS and human engineers having suboptimal topologies, and
SGD and other training processes being highly inefficient

relative to their biological equivalents. Modern’s research program uses proprietary advances in information theory to train hierarchical neural networks, or HNNs, with modular intermediate levels of structure that address the problem of multiscale competence. (See a recent interview with Dr. Michael Levin [video][transcript] to learn more about the high-level biological insights that motivate multiscale competence as a desirable [and possibly necessary] factor for robustness and efficient learning of high-complexity problems.)

About the position:
Pay: $3,500 / month for half-time or $7,000 / month for full-time

We’re looking for a curious and insightful student who believes that the answer isn’t just more data, and who has a deep appreciation of the benefits of sparsity, hierarchy, efficiency, and taking the right lessons from biology. With your team at Modern, you’ll get hands-on experience with some of the hardest problems in ML from both the product and the research direction. You’ll help build Modern’s research community, and will contribute directly to a research program that creates and trains HNNs in order to address the multiscale competence problem, work towards natural robustness in neural networks, and create general re-usable neural modules that can be leveraged in future learning. You’ll have as much guidance as you need and as much project ownership as you want, including the opportunity and encouragement to propose, design, and run your own experiments, and to publish the results.
Basic Qualifications:
Recent PhD or active enrollment in a PhD program in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or related field. Undergraduates and masters students will be considered if their application is sufficiently strong.
Strong proficiency in coding and data science
Competence, and ideally proficiency, in at least one popular ML framework, e.g. Tensorflow or Pytorch.

Some project-level experience in AI / ML, with publications preferred but not required
Excellent communication skills, and the ability to work effectively in a team

Our financial technology creates more valuable, efficient properties by turning unpredictable loss and damage into dependable operating income, getting each lease closer to zero balance.

Come help us make it happen!
Interesting Problems
The Data Science team identifies, designs and implements algorithms that lie at the heart of Amperity's products. We focus on a few areas:
Identity matching: deduplicate and group billions of records to their underlying identities daily. Our customers use our predictions to create a personalized experience for their customers at every touchpoint.
Predictive scoring: With unified and enriched customer profiles (thanks to our entity matching algorithms), we build advanced customer-centric models to predict metrics/behaviors such as customer lifetime value, customer churn, product recommendations, and event propensity.

We highly encourage individuals of underrepresented groups to apply!
Application deadline: January 11th, 2023 @ 11:59pm MT

Program Overview
The ClimateAlignedIndustries (CAI) Program focuses on decarbonizing hard to abate sectors, implementing market mechanisms and supporting policy implementation to limit global warming to 1.5oC and achieve cost parity for decarbonization solutions. It currently brings together heavy industry sectors (aviation, cement, chemicals, steel and shipping) with our cross-cutting green hydrogen projects (The GreenHydrogen Catapult and Industrial Hubs). The Waste Methane Initiative leverages this sectoral approach in rethinking the whole waste value chain to catalyze industry change and transition to a more circular economy.
The WasteMethane initiative aims to reduce methane emissions from the waste sector, starting with municipal solid waste, by tackling organic waste and its associated emissions across the entire value chain.As the third largest contributor of anthropogenic methane emissions, accounting for almost 20% of methane emissions, the waste sector is critical to meeting our global climate targets. We’re partnering with waste management companies, policy makers, financial institutions, and the academic community to improve emissions visibility and mobilize resources in the waste sector.

610,Data Engineer (Brain-Computer Interface Team),AE Studio,Full-time,Remote,PostedPosted 30+ days ago,/rc/clk?jk=a42c5ac8e28b17b2&fccid=dbb7e0d690f678bb&vjs=3,"Are you a data engineer who is excited about brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that increase human agency? Are you a self-starter who is comfortable with ambiguity and wants to tackle challenging engineering problems? Do you want to work with a world-class remote team while having a big impact on the data infrastructure for an early-stage project?
We are looking for a Data Engineer who is interested in working with us at AE Studio on the future of neurotechnology!
About AE Studio
AE Studio is a mid-sized startup from California. We have a team of highly skilled developers, designers, and data scientists building products that increase human agency. We use the most recent technologies to develop solutions for startups as well as large companies like Samsung and Berkshire Hathaway. We have an awesome work environment and a highly productive process.
One of AE Studio’s core missions is to develop brain-computer interface technologies that increase human agency. We are looking for someone with experience in data engineering, strong problem-solving skills, self-management skills, and enthusiasm to learn more about the intersection of data science and neuroscience.
About the Role
You will work full-time on software, tools, and data infrastructure for BCI technology as we work to develop an operating system for BCI applications. Initially, you will be structuring neural datasets for use in machine learning. As your project grows, you’ll build toolsets and pipelines to convert between common neurodata formats, manage data architecture in the cloud to support machine learning, and work on open-source neurodata format and standard projects (such as Neurodata Without Borders or MNE). This is a highly dynamic role that will require a bright and flexible engineer with excellent problem-solving skills.
You:
Are a mature Python developer who follows best practices and writes clean code
Have experience building Python packages and applications for production environments
Have experience building data pipelines and data management utilities
Have a solid foundation in data engineering best practices
Are comfortable working in a cloud environment
Have experience with scientific computing (including but not limited to: writing software to collect data from laboratory instruments, to control those instruments, or to model physical systems based on scientific theory)
Have included a link to your public code repository (e.g. GitHub) in your application
Bonus Points For:
Experience with managing AWS infrastructure for a project (EC2, S3, databases, IAM, etc)
Experience with unit testing in Python
Experience contributing to the open-source community
Machine learning and/or data science experience
Neuroscience and/or BCI experience
What do you get out of it??
Opportunity to work on world-changing technology
Collaborative & friendly remote work environment (we're all nice )
Good pay
Reasonable & flexible work hours
Private health insurance plan
Yearly retreat bringing together our teams from across the world
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Equity
Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.
At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.
Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.
We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.
Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.

646,Chief Science Officer,PerfectRec,"From $250,000 a year Employer est.","Remote in Seattle, WA",PostedPosted 30+ days ago,/rc/clk?jk=a51dfe30ee6928cf&fccid=dd616958bd9ddc12&vjs=3,"About PerfectRec
PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)
We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves.
We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.
A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact
PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and U.C. Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact.
Founder Led, Founder Funded
Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine.
Working At PerfectRec
We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.
PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.
What You'll Do
The Machine Learning team focuses on developing and improving our recommendation engine in conjunction with the Software Engineering team, led by CTO Dallas Tester, and the Product Expert team, currently led by our CEO/Head of Product Joe Golden, to whom you'll report. The Machine Learning team was established by Professor Josh Hug over the summer, who will continue to work with us (and with you!) part-time during the academic year. More nitty gritty details about the ML Team's responsibilities can be found at the end of this page.
You'll be responsible for the recommendation engine at the heart of the company, which asks users a series of questions and provides a ranked list of recommendations with explanations about why those recommendations meet their needs. We're at the first step in our journey toward creating a decision engine that enables users to make faster, more accurate decisions in any part of their life.
As the Chief Science Officer with a focus on machine learning, you'll:
Orchestrate all machine learning efforts at PerfectRec, including defining strategy from both a product and technical perspective
Grow and lead our team of machine learning engineers and data scientists.
Work directly with the rest of the executive team, engineers and product experts to plan and execute cross-team efforts.
Participate in the hands-on development activities across the ML stack until the team is hired and self-sufficient. To see the hands-on activities for individual contributors on the team, check out the Machine Learning Engineering / Data Scientist job posting.
What You'll Bring
Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You'll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress.
Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential data sources are limitless. You'll be able to evaluate and explore existing sets of data, suggest new sources of data, and be able to build models that learn from this data in novel ways.
Aptitude for building and leading a team. You'll be responsible for finding the right folks for the job and guiding them through their careers.
Eagerness to teach and learn. As a company, we're always evolving with new tools and practices. You'll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this.
Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You'll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest.
Clear and concise communication. As an executive running the machine learning arm of the organization, you'll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication with both internal and external entities. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1.
Relevant Experience
10+ years of relevant professional and/or academic experience in data science, machine learning, or related research.
5+ years leading and managing a team.
Expert understanding of relevant methods in statistics, data science, and machine learning.
Fluency in languages, frameworks, and tools related to machine learning (e.g. Python, SQL, SKLearn, SageMaker).
Recommender systems experience.
Salary & Benefits
We believe in offering generous compensation and benefits tailored to our all-remote workplace. We pay well because we want to work with highly motivated people that will help make the company successful.
Pay Range
$250,000+ salary and stock options which vest over 4 years based on your background and experience
Benefits
100% remote and no cost-of-living pay cuts. We want you to work where you work best and we are not going to ""adjust"" your pay if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.
We pay 100% of your and your dependents' healthcare premium in a high-quality, national PPO plan for US-based employees. For international employees, we will work with you if you're not covered by your national health plan.
We will buy the office equipment you need to succeed. Lots of companies are miserly about equipment. We are not going to do that because your time is valuable.
401k with generous matching. Once we have 20 employees, we'll set up a 401k program with generous matching.
Generous PTO. We trust everyone to take time off appropriately for themselves. We're pro-regular vacations - not taking regular breaks isn't good for individuals or the team. Once we have 20 employees, we will establish a more formal PTO policy.
Worry-free sick days. If you're sick, take the time off to get well. Just let your manager know as soon as practicable.
Free products that we're reviewing. We are becoming product experts together, and we will send you cool stuff like monitors and TVs as we add new recommendation lines. (Unfortunately, we probably won't be able to do this for cars.)
What The ML Team Does (as of July 2022)
To provide some more specific content, the ML team's engine takes responses to product questions (e.g. ""I want a medium-sized $600-$800 Android phone, I care a ton about the camera quality, but I don't care about the battery life."") and returns a ranked list of recommendations. The engine also returns an explanation of each recommendation and a summary explanation that considers all recommendations. Responses are currently collected through a series of one-click multiple choice questions, though other input modalities will become available. An example is given below:
The ML team's work encompasses the entire workflow, including but not limited to:
Building and evaluating candidate models, including identification of appropriate metrics and QA processes.
Working with product experts to identify relevant products and product traits for each product category, e.g. in the phone category, creating the table of 30+ recommendable phones and their properties. Or in other words, defining the range of the model.
Working with product experts to identify the appropriate questions to ask the user, e.g. in the phone category, we currently ask for the OS, size, budget, camera quality preference, and battery quality preference, in that order. Or in other words, defining the domain of the model.
Creating tools and workflows for product experts to provide model training data.
Shared infrastructural details, including database storage and model deployment are primarily handled by the software engineering team. More generally, Dallas's engineering team is responsible for ML ops, with input from and collaboration with the ML team, so the ML team can focus primarily on modeling."

This task needs to be approached sensitively: deciding too soon, or too permissively, could result in greater resistance to use of the surveys and/or less actual survey use, which would reduce the effectiveness of dashboards and reports which will use survey data. Success on this task will result in as widespread of use as possible, within appropriate limits (for example, none of the surveys is designed for use on a daily basis, or for every single program conducted).
Develop M&E Toolkit training in cooperation with ECA/MELI, the ECA/A/M Vienna Training Office, and other American Spaces practitioners to ensure (1) sufficient piloting during development that will ensure effective decisions about deployment, and (2) timely adoption by necessary users globally. Deliver such training, including training REPS as trainers who will also be able to deliver the same training within their portfolios. Various rounds of training will be necessary, as additional M&E Toolkit components are deployed.
Coordinate with the rest of the Policy Unit, ECA/MELI, the Field Support Unit, and REPS to schedule pilot testing, recruit participants, and scale up from pilot testing to full-scale use of M&E Toolkit components. Various rounds of piloting and scale up will be necessary, as additional M&E Toolkit components are deployed.
Recommend to the Policy Unit Chief how use of OASIS and the M&E Toolkit may be best reflected in revisions to the American Spaces Handbook, American Spaces Standards, and other policy documents such as descriptions of the Five Pillars, policy on what constitutes a Space (including different scales of Spaces).
Just as importantly, work with all of these interested parties to develop new reports and dashboards that will utilize the M&E Toolkit data, presenting those data in various formats appropriate to the needs and interests of various potential users. This will require determining which reports and dashboards would best be built internal to OASIS vs being hosted on the Vision 21 or data.state.sbu internal website/SharePoint platforms, and which users (potentially including non-USG Spaces staff who will have OASIS accounts) should be able to access each report and dashboard.
Work with the Field Support Unit and the rest of the Policy Unit to develop tools that will improve the ASSF process and further demonstrate the effectiveness of ASSF investments. In addition to work on OASIS itself, this task potentially includes:
Modeling, or working with data scientists in the ECA/EX/IT OASIS and Vision 21 Teams and/or CfA to model, whether there are correlations between funding and outputs or, better still, outcomes.
Developing recommendations for baseline target funding to be received by each country and/or Space. Initially, such recommendations could be based on historical funding levels, and independent estimates of the costs required to successfully operate a Space. As these efforts mature, such recommendations could include developing a funding index that takes into account the various factors that influence needs, the factors contributing to success that ECA/A/M wants to emphasize, and the disparities associated with Purchasing Power Parity as well as historical practices to designate some Spaces as “Priority” Spaces.
Recommending approaches to quantifying the funding shortfall for American Spaces. This may include developing independent estimates of the costs required to successfully operate Spaces of various sizes, types, and longevities; developing and implementing for-attribution surveys that obtain objective information about funding shortfalls; and/or improved tracking through OASIS of the funding being used by posts and Spaces from sources other than ASSF.
Recommend whether pursuing interoperability with the Salesforce-based PD Tools and CRM applications is viable, and if so, how best to accomplish interoperability to minimize data entry workload for users and maximize the potential benefits to users.
Maintain a commanding knowledge of the interrelated nature of all of these data projects, so as to ensure that they all move forward in ways that are complementary to each other without leaving important gaps in their ability to meet American Spaces practitioners’.

This includes nondiscrimination in activities and projects supported by the Department, including Title VI, Title IX, nondiscrimination for individuals with disabilities and all other civil rights mandates. OCR develops policies and administers programs for implementing civil rights.

The Department recognizes that its leaders and workforce must embrace the tenets of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA). Executive Order 14035 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce, Executive Order 14020 on Establishment of the White House Gender Policy Council, and Executive Order 13985 Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities1 Through the Federal Government create an integrated focus on DEIA which enhances the diversity of the Department’s workforce and broadens its outreach to underserved communities. The nation is becoming more and more diverse. Therefore, it is necessary to leverage the various talent pools of the nation's population to maximize productivity. The underutilization of the workforce results in missed opportunities for innovation and productivity. In addition, workplace discrimination leads to financial losses related to losing and replacing workers. Committing to DEIA principles will help correct these operational and economical inefficiencies.

The Department is committed to delivering on the goals and values expressed in Executive Order 13985. The Department will better serve its workforce and customers if we reflect and leverage the nation's diversity. A diverse workforce with a diverse leadership will be more likely to understand the needs of a diverse customer base. Including a variety of viewpoints and experiences will result in better solutions that will meet the nation’s future needs.

Additional personnel are required to ensure that the Department makes progress in OPM’s DEIA Maturity Model that is used to determine the status of DEIA across the federal government.

To accelerate Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) efforts at the Department of Commerce (DOC), a DEIA function must be adequately staffed and resourced.

Who are we?
Apollo Neuroscience is pioneering new ways to empower people to live healthier lives by addressing the root of stress and anxiety: the nervous system. Balancing and calming the nervous system is essential to building resilience to stress. Originating from research in neuroscience and psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, Apollo Neuro, our debut product, is the first scientifically-validated technology to improve the body’s resilience to stress. Unlike most other wearables, Apollo Neuro is not a biometric tracker, it is a wearable therapeutic that uses vibration to support the body’s recovery from stress.
Apollo Neuro’s culture is built on a deep and genuine commitment to improve access to mental health. We’re a growing start-up that’s through Series A, and our shared value is empathy. Kindness and inclusion are key, and we have a respectful and friendly company culture. Our departments function collaboratively and intimately to build rapport and support individuals. We’re an entirely remote, distributed team with roots in Pittsburgh and the Bay area.
About our work environment:
When you join Apollo Neuro, you join a team that values empathy, respect, and a strong work ethic. As an employee, you’ll join the team on a journey of mission-driven rapid growth, with a real opportunity to influence the company, product, and users. Apollo Neuro employees receive competitive compensation, and benefits including competitive PTO, healthcare benefits, 401K with a match, and more.
We’re results focused, and we believe that clearly defined goals combined with great people, empowerment, and autonomy create the highest quality results. We’re confident that inclusive and diverse teams working toward an important mission have the capacity to create extraordinary impact.

Who are you:
We’re looking for a results-driven Senior Data Analyst who can dive into our business intelligence data and help bring our product development, customer acquisition, and retention efforts to the next level. You are an expert in gathering business requirements and translating them to data solutions, and highly skilled at defining use cases and simplifying complex concepts. Your work will be integral to informing our strategy and operations.
As Sr. Data Analyst, you will need to work closely with various departments. Experience managing multiple stakeholders is a must and experience leading a team is a big bonus. You will work cross-functionally with data engineering and department stakeholders to extract insights about the performance of our marketing, product usage and customer lifecycle efforts. You’ll also be the key driver for cohort analyses, attribution and lifetime value modeling.
You have demonstrated experience in Marketing and Product analytics, and have a high level of comfort with the concepts and methodologies for attribution, incrementality, a/b and split testing, product experimentation, cohort tables, and subscription and customer retention dynamics. You have worked with data feeds from e-commerce martech, in-app, and platform-based channels like paid social, search, email/customer lifecycle, and SaaS/subscription products.

(”EonLabs”), will be solely and independently responsible for discovering and creating features for cryptocurrency futures contracts (i.e. BTCUSDTPERP and ETHUSDTPERP) and eventually controlling a Binance sub-account and to generate EAV (Extended Asset Value) for it with algorithmic market-timing directional trading strategies, which are either created by you or by EonLabs’ machine learning system (Enigma Trading System). In any cases, you have the freedom to choose to be employed by EonLabs or just profit share with EonLabs. (If you’re in the United States, you’re free to choose W2 or C2C.) What're their pros and cons? Please read https://bit.ly/feature_engineer
In case you want to skip everything and get right to the point, you may want to schedule a meeting with our Director of Operations (DO): https://calendly.com/eonlabs/do
〄 Compensation
We use machine learning algorithms to design market-timing directional mid-frequency algorithmic strategies to trade crypto futures contracts with our proprietary funds. Therefore, the position is highly performance-based. We feel the need to alert you that you won't be finding working for/with EonLabs rewarding unless you have pre-existing, well-defined, and proven crypto futures contract leading technical/sentiment indicator(s) or strategies to add to our mix of features or portfolio of strategies.
〄 〄 For experienced crypto futures contract traders
If you have proven algorithmic trading strategies and their track records (even backtesting results are acceptable),
you are eligible to connect to EonLabs’ funded Binance sub-account so that you can start profit share off of the EAV of high water mark at monthly crystallization frequency;
EonLabs will proportionately inject additional funds into the sub-account on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly) so as to raise your potential earnings; and

〄 〄 For the experienced manual traders
If you have proven mechanical trading system(s) for the crypto futures contracts that has/have clear and non-repainting logics, they can potentially be tabulated into time series features if not trading bots. Your expertise in overseeing them and applying them to the appropriate market regimes can be rewarding for you.

〄 〄 For the inexperienced but aspiring crypto-algorithmic traders
read https://bit.ly/feature_engineer
〄 〄 For those who only have novel features or ideas of features
read https://bit.ly/feature_engineer
〄 What We Are Not!
No, we are not funded trader programs popping up all over the internet that need you to fork out a subscription or audition fee.
No, we are not a blockchain-based business. We are not involved in any blockchain projects. Although we admire those who strive to improve decentralization technology, we are merely traders of their derivative instruments.
No, we don’t trade the conventional markets (e.g. stocks, options, index futures, forex, and bonds) because they are too efficient compared to the emerging markets (e.g. crypto)
No, we are not here to steal your trading ideas because you keep all your feature rule sets and source codes to yourself. During assessment period, you do not have to share your intellectual property (i.e. ideas, logics & codes) with us until your novel feature output values are validated by our machine learning system.
No intellectual properties are exchanged until the robustness of your features' output values are validated by our machine-learning system and partnership terms (employment or profit-sharing) fully expounded and agreed by you.
〄 Qualifications - Skills and Experience
Have either: Pre-existing, well-defined, and proven crypto futures contract leading technical or sentiment indicator(s) to add to our mix of features for time series forecasting; or existing algorithmic trading strategies that can potentially trade crypto futures contracts with certain degree of success.
Desirable: Know the meaning of: 1. funded trader programs, 2. objective functions, 3. Calmar ratio, 4. Sortino ratio, 5. risk adjusted return, 6. drawdown, 7. pine script language, 8. lagging technical indicators, 9. features in time series forecasting, 10. look-ahead bias, 11. TA-Lib; and real-money (not just some backtested, simulation or paper trading results) algorithmic trading experience and track records.
For more, read: https://bit.ly/feature_engineer
〄 Assessment - What you have to do?
If you have existing crypto-algorithmic futures contract trading strategies, please share their simulated or historical backtesting performance analysis reports with EonLabs by contacting us immediately, preferably with graphically presented equity curve chart. We will evaluate it. Depending on its performance matrices, such as Calmar Ratio, we’ll talk more. We’ll also take market regime into consideration as well, i.e., it’s fine that if your strategy can only perform well in certain market situation.
(All assessment is unpaid. During assessment phase, there’s no need to share your code. No need to share your ideas and know-how. No need to share performance analysis derived from in-sample trained models unless it is accompanied by out-of-sample one because it is no-brainer to build forecasting models on in-sample dataset, especially when curve-fit by deep learning tools.)
If you DO NOT HAVE existing crypto-algorithmic futures contract trading strategies, please continue with the following.
Data Reduction. Use Binance official GitHub repository (binance / binance-public-data) Python scripts (https://bit.ly/binance-scripts) to download historical OHLCV candlestick bar data of the spot market (e.g. ETHUSDT) or perpetual futures contract market (e.g. ETHUSDTPERP). On the other hand, if needed by certain novel features, download the trade (tick-by-tick) data and manipulate them into custom data representations, such as range bar data format which is demarcated by fixed interval of price instead of candlestick bar data format which is demarcated by fixed interval of time.
Novel Features Building. Make sense of forefront time series forecasting research papers and develop novel machine learning features that are unavailable in the public domain (e.g. TA-Lib). If you’re familiar with wizard-based indicator builders, such as Neural Shell Trader, it’s even better. Feel free to use them to build features so that we can evaluate the results more easily. If you’re interested to use limited order book (LOB) data to create features, please download the sample LOB data of BTC futures from our Google Drive storage: https://bit.ly/sample_lob_binance_futures
Evaluation. Send feature output values to EonLabs so that we can help you benchmark them against other features that we have. Note that feature output must be presented in the format of a comma delimited csv file with five (5) default columns (Date, Open, High, Low, Close) and the feature column(s). “Date” timestamp format is as follows: YYYY-MM-DD hh: mm: ss.fff (e.g. 2017-08-17 04:59:59.999). Demarcation of rows can be defined by other rule(s) instead of just time (e.g. range bar).
API Implementation. If the feature values are validated by EonLabs machine learning system to have some degree of predictive power but you’d rather keep the feature rule sets and source codes to yourself, employment is not a viable option then. For more, read: https://bit.ly/feature_engineer

Application Question(s):
Just a little heads-up before we go on to the next step. The area of algorithmic trading is one that is very specialized, and so are we. Even if time series forecasting might be helpful in a range of natural science research, the field of financial science is more analogous to social science, which is more of an art, despite the fact that it deals with data on a daily basis.

You won't be able to take the knowledge you gain here with you to other fields of work. Are you certain that this is what you want to do? And if your answer is ""YES,"" why?

Unwrap.ai is on a mission to make every company more customer centric. We're helping companies collect and process feedback more effectively from sources like Zendesk, App Store reviews, Reddit, and Twitter. We also build tools to help users feel heard by making it easier for them to submit feedback and follow relevant product improvements.
Our founders, two ex-Amazon Alexa Product Managers, were tired of manually sifting through customer reviews, support tickets, and bugs while working on Alexa. They understood the importance of listening to customers and prioritizing their requests effectively, but simply had too much feedback to parse through. So, Unwrap.ai was born to solve this problem. Specifically, at Unwrap we use Natural Language Processing to automatically cluster, tag, and analyze customer feedback to help product and engineering teams build what customers want. The ultimate goal is to make companies more customer centric and focus on the product improvements that matter most. We're currently a team of 5, have a number of name-brand paying customers, and just recently raised a $3M seed round. We are backed by leading investors including the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Cercano Management, and Kevin O'Connor's ScOp VC (former founder and CEO of DoubleClick).

The Role
We are seeking a talented engineer who's passionate about NLP, and who has experience building real-world NLP features from the ground up. This is an applied role, so we value shipping features over research. You'll own major customer-facing systems, train and fine-tune models, scale NLP systems to meet production requirements, and implement business logic to integrate with Unwrap's product. In order to succeed in the role, you'll need to understand customer needs, research new technical approaches, and have strong communication skills. The successful candidate will be involved in all parts of the company, but will focus primarily on designing and building our system's ability to generate insights from written feedback.
Our NLP stack is Python. Data is structured and stored using MySQL. Experience in these technologies is strongly encouraged.

What You Get
Ground floor impact at a seed-stage startup with tremendous latitude over technical strategy and approach
Significant, potentially life-changing equity
Ability to rapidly advance your career alongside company growth
Collaborate with experienced teammates, entrepreneurs, and advisors
Competitive pay, benefits, and stock options commensurate with a seed-stage venture-backed company
About You
You're an incredible engineer with experience building applied NLP applications, and have experience shipping real-world products.
You are excited about the prospect of making companies more customer-centric
You are excited about how Natural Language Processing has and will continue to transform our world
You bring an independent and entrepreneurial attitude. Evidence of previous entrepreneurial or start-up experience is a plus
You love building NLP, but also are able to contribute to other company activities like product roadmap creation and customer discovery
You are authorized to work in the United States without sponsorship"

We invented a new type of credit card backed by assets (secured by equity in your home, cars, & other assets), enabling us to offer mind-bendingly low APRs to consumers. Our first product is the world’s lowest APR credit card. Come invent & change the world with us.
Who are we?
We are a well capitalized (over $130MM in equity funding) team of technology (Microsoft, Facebook), and finance (Square, Discover, CapitalOne, and Goldman) executives with top tier investors - Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, Max Levchin, NYCA, Sequoia, etc.
Our team includes people who have built
Financial products (Square/CashApp, the earliest CapitalOne credit cards)
Consumer products (Internet.org, Xbox)
Technology infrastructure (Visual Studio, Windows & Azure, helped design the C++ & C# languages)
Mathematics & science infrastructure (computational research at NASA’s JPL).
We are missionaries that like to work hard on important problems - and build products that become infrastructure for society. We believe that using technology to lower the cost of capital for consumers is one of these problems - and if we can do it, it could have a big impact on a lot of people’s lives.
Our philosophy
We are a technology company at heart - and we seek to invent & advance the state of the art to build insanely great consumer financial products - starting with the world’s first home-equity backed credit card.
We like to deeply understand the nuances & excruciating details of the systems we are building on top of - whether it be legal frameworks & regs, or APIs and 3rd party data-providers. No work is beneath any of us - from the CEO to our compliance lead - we get excited to audit our database to check each cell to ensure that they are correct and to pick up customer support calls.
We believe inventing great products happens at the intersection of extremely deep detailed domain knowledge & a very lateral thought process. We don’t like to invent for the sake of it - we do it when we think we can make something significantly better.
We value being pragmatic, rational, fast, minimalist, detailed oriented, and obsessively customer-centric.
